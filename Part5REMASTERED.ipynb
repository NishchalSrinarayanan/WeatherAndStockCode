What I did to add the thousand marks was the same format for the .2f, for example, if I wanted to display pi, But only to 2 spaces, I would store pi into a variable, and print that variable like this: {number:.2f}.\n",
        "Now, if I wanted to display a number, ex: 1300202, but wanted thousand marks, I would do the same thing, but add a comma like this: {number:,}. Now, to show the total portfolio profit, I at the start, set the portfolio profit to zero. After each tuple, I add the profit of the stock to the total profit, and when all tuples are done looping, the total portfolio profit is printed.\n",
